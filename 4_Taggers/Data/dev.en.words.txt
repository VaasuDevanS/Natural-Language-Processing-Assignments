From
the
AP
comes
this
story
:

President
Bush
on
Tuesday
nominated
two
individuals
to
replace
retiring
jurists
on
federal
courts
in
the
Washington
area
.

Bush
nominated
Jennifer
M.
Anderson
for
a
15
-
year
term
as
associate
judge
of
the
Superior
Court
of
the
District
of
Columbia
,
replacing
Steffen
W.
Graae
.

***

Bush
also
nominated
A.
Noel
Anketell
Kramer
for
a
15
-
year
term
as
associate
judge
of
the
District
of
Columbia
Court
of
Appeals
,
replacing
John
Montague
Steadman
.

The
sheikh
in
wheel
-
chair
has
been
attacked
with
a
F
-
16
-
launched
bomb
.

He
could
be
killed
years
ago
and
the
israelians
have
all
the
reasons
,
since
he
founded
and
he
is
the
spiritual
leader
of
Hamas
,
but
they
did
n't
.

Today
's
incident
proves
that
Sharon
has
lost
his
patience
and
his
hope
in
peace
.

Nervous
people
make
mistakes
,
so
I
suppose
there
will
be
a
wave
of
succesfull
arab
attacks
.

A
la
guerre
c'est
comme
a
la
guerre
!

In
the
eastern
city
of
Baqubah
,
guerrillas
detonated
a
car
bomb
outside
a
police
station
,
killing
several
people
.

The
US
lost
yet
another
helicopter
to
hostile
fire
near
Habbaniyah
in
the
Sunni
heartland
,
but
this
time
the
crew
was
safe
.

In
Fallujah
,
hundreds
of
demonstrators
came
out
against
US
troops
when
they
briefly
arrested
a
yound
newlywed
bride
.

(
I
hope
that
the
US
army
got
an
enormous
amount
of
information
from
her
relatives
,
because
otherwise
this
move
was
a
bad
,
bad
tradeoff
)
.

The
US
troops
fired
into
the
hostile
crowd
,
killing
4
.

It
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
manhunt
for
high
Baath
officials
in
the
Sunni
heartland
is
being
done
wrong
,
or
at
least
in
ways
that
are
bad
for
US
standing
with
local
Iraqis
.

Google
has
finally
had
an
analyst
day
--
a
chance
to
present
the
company
's
story
to
the
(
miniscule
number
of
)
people
who
have
n't
heard
it
.

Usually
,
these
are
just
a
chance
for
the
suckups
to
suck
up
,
but
this
time
people
are
actually
concerned
about
the
company
's
plans
.

They
work
on
Wall
Street
,
after
all
,
so
when
they
hear
a
company
who's
stated
goals
include
"
Do
n't
be
evil
,
"
they
imagine
a
company
who's
eventually
history
will
be
"
Do
n't
be
profitable
.
"

It
's
not
quite
as
freewheeling
an
environment
as
you
'd
imagine
:
Sergey
Brin
has
actually
created
a
mathematical
'
proof
'
that
the
company
's
self
-
driven
research
strategy
,
which
gives
employees
one
day
a
week
to
do
research
projects
on
their
own
,
is
a
good
,
respectable
idea
.

Read
the
entire
article
;
there
's
a
punchline
,
too
.

My
opinion
piece
on
the
implications
of
Arafat
's
passing
for
al
-
Qaeda
has
appeared
at
Newsday
.

Excerpt
:

"
Arafat
's
secular
nationalism
was
supple
enough
to
compromise
with
Israel
and
to
imagine
a
two
-
state
solution
,
even
if
the
road
of
negotiations
remained
rocky
.

The
continued
Israeli
colonization
of
the
occupied
Palestinian
territories
during
the
1990s
helped
,
along
with
terrorist
attacks
by
radical
groups
such
as
Hamas
,
to
derail
the
peace
process
,
which
Sharon
had
always
opposed
.

Arafat
's
death
creates
a
vacuum
in
Palestinian
leadership
that
will
not
soon
be
filled
.

Sharon
's
assassination
of
major
Hamas
leaders
has
also
weakened
authority
structures
in
that
party
.

If
the
Israelis
and
the
Palestinian
leadership
can
not
find
a
way
to
reinvigorate
the
peace
process
,
cells
of
radical
young
Palestinians
may
grow
up
that
look
to
bin
Laden
for
their
cues
.

Even
if
local
Palestinian
leaders
remain
strong
enough
to
keep
al
-
Qaida
out
,
the
festering
Israeli
-
Palestinian
struggle
remains
among
the
best
recruiting
posters
for
al
-
Qaida
with
young
Muslim
men
.

Resolving
this
conflict
would
be
the
most
effective
weapon
the
United
States
could
deploy
in
its
war
on
terror
.
"

Xinhua
reports
that
a
wide
range
of
Iraqi
political
forces
on
Tuesday
condemned
Sharon
's
murder
of
Sheikh
Ahmed
Yassin
,
a
religious
leader
of
Hamas
,
the
day
before
.

The
Board
of
Muslim
clerics
in
Fallujah
,
50
km
west
of
Baghdad
,
"
condemned
the
assassination
and
promised
immediate
revenge
against
the
coalition
soldiers
in
Iraq
.
"

Ash
-
Sharq
al
-
Awsat
reports
that
Fallujah
was
closed
Tuesday
in
a
general
strike
.

US
troops
there
clashed
with
guerrillas
in
a
fight
that
left
one
Iraqi
dead
.

In
Ramadi
,
there
was
a
big
demonstration
.

Radical
Shiite
cleric
Muqtada
al
-
Sadr
said
the
attack
was
"
criminal
"
and
that
"
the
Zionists
have
left
only
one
choice
for
the
Arabs
,
that
of
fighting
and
jihad
"
.

The
interim
Governing
Council
issued
a
communique
saying
,
"
It
is
a
proof
of
the
emptiness
of
the
Israeli
authority
and
a
destruction
of
the
peace
endeavors
in
the
region
.
.
.

This
operation
would
only
consolidate
the
terrorist
acts
in
the
world
and
would
not
bring
peace
to
the
region
,
"
the
message
claimed
.

Xinhua
alleged
that
"
Many
of
the
Iraqis
,
who
suffer
the
American
occupation
of
Iraq
,
relate
their
case
with
that
of
the
Palestinian
people
,
under
the
Israeli
occupation
.
"

In
an
apparently
unrelated
incidents
,
some
eleven
Iraqis
were
killed
by
snipers
on
Tuesday
,
including
a
group
of
police
trainees
in
a
bus
near
Hilla
and
two
police
in
Kirkuk
.

Ever
since
the
first
whispers
about
Google
's
IPO
,
most
investors
have
feared
that
the
stock
would
come
public
at
such
a
ridiculously
high
price
that
,
even
with
a
spectacularly
profitable
business
model
and
some
nearly
flawless
execution
,
the
price
would
be
too
high
for
investors
to
make
a
real
profit
.

We
've
moved
on
.

We
've
grown
up
.

Now
,
people
wonder
if
Google
can
even
survive
.

That
's
overstating
it
,
I
know
.

What
they
wonder
is
whether
Google
can
be
anything
more
than
what
it
's
always
been
--
a
great
search
engine
with
some
real
grass
-
roots
support
,
successful
by
the
grace
of
simplicity
.

Simplicity
gave
it
that
blessed
,
laudatory
lack
of
clutter
,
the
efficient
and
effective
text
-
based
ads
,
and
the
support
of
anyone
with
a
dial
-
up
connection
.

The
problem
is
that
customers
attracted
by
a
simple
interface
are
among
the
least
loyal
you
can
find
--
witness
the
fight
-
for
-
fewest
-
features
between
low
-
end
camera
companies
.

The
other
problem
?

It
's
tough
to
make
money
branching
out
when
your
appeal
is
in
your
focus
.
